			<p class="about mt-5">
				We are a company who supply prints of the most beautiful ukiyo-e
				artworks over the past centuries. I initially got interested in
				ukiyo-e art on my first trip to Japan, the remnants of
				historical art are visible everywhere and the ukiyo-e style is
				visible in Japanese manga and cartoons today. One of the
				memories which stuck with me was a visit to
				<a
					href="https://web-production-9793.up.railway.app/products/artist_detail/Katsushika%20Hokusai"
					>Katsushika Hokusai’s</a
				>
				Museum in Obuse, arguably the grandfather of Ukiyo-e art, the
				patience and perfection dedicated to this skill is what
				influenced me to ensure as much people as possible can decorate
				and appreciate this artwork as possible.

			<h3 class="mt-5">What is Ukiyo-e</h3>

			<p class="about mt-5">
				The original designs are created by using Woodblock print, this
				means the artists carve out the shape of each layer and print
				with ink before repeating this activity several times. As you
				can imagine, this is an extremely time consuming and meticulous
				activity, but this is what allows for such depth and precision.
			</p>

			<p class="about mt-5">
				We supply replica prints from the most popular and famous
				artists. Ukiyo-e art began around the Edo Period (1615-1868) in
				Tokyo. The peak period was during the 19th century. These first
				artworks depicted pictures of nature sure as mountains,
				waterfalls, flowers, and wildlife. One Product which encompasses
				this is Hokusai’s,
				<a

					>Rōben Waterfall at Ōyama in Sagami Province</a
				>
			</p>

			<p class="about mt-5">
				The creation of Ukiyo-e art continued during the Meiji Period
				(1868-1912) however the styles and themes presented are much
				different. Throughout the Meiji Period the focus shifted away
				from nature and a greater inclusion of Western influence in
				Japan, which can be seen in Yoshiiku's
				<a
					href="https://web-production-9793.up.railway.app/products/73525/"
					>The Flourishing of an English Trading Firm in Yokohama </a
				>. The Meiji Period also carried its own style in darker colour
				used.
